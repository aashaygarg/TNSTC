In April 1981, the launch of the American space shuttle Columbia ushered in a period of reliance on the reusable shuttle for most civilian space missions, which would go on for over 30 years. However, the shuttle program was not without tragedy, with the Challenger disaster in 1986 and the Columbia disaster in 2003, resulting in the deaths of 14 astronauts. Discovery was the first of the three active space shuttles to be retired, completing its final mission on March 9, 2011; Endeavour did so on June 1. The final shuttle mission was completed with the landing of Atlantis on July 21, 2011, closing the 30-year space shuttle program.
